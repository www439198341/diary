**The** pie chart compare five catigories of household expenditure in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

**It** is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both contries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. **Also**, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.
***
**In** 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household bugdet went on food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. **By** 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. **By** contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.
***
**Leisure** activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both year, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. **In** fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on recreation(17%) as UK residents(34%). **In** both countries, transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.
