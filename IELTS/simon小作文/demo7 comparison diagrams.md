**QUESTION**

**ESSAY**
***
**The** two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.
***
**We** can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. **There** are no plans to change external walls or entrances.
***
**The** most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. **This** will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. **With** no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.
***
**To** replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. **The** internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. **Finally**, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.
