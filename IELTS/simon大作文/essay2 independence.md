#### ESSAY
**People** have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. **In** my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.

**There** are two main reasons why it could be aruged that we are more dependent on each other now. **Firstly**, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. **For example**, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. **Property** prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. **Secondly**, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quaility of life for their families. **This** means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support form grandparents and babysitters for child care.

**However**, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. **In** most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. **We** alse have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. **For example**, my students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. **Another** factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of world.

**In conclusion**, while there are some reasons to believe that people now dependent on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.
