####ESSAY
**Governments** in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. **I** completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.

**There** are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. **Firstly**, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at a huge cose to government. **Secondly**, these programmes do not benifit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. **Finally**, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. **The** Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.

**I** beleive that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead. **It** is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space exploration projects. **Furthermore**, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. **For** example, we all use schools, hospitals, and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. **If** governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.

**In** conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benifits all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.
