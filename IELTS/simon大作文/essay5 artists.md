#### ESSAY
**People** have different views about the funding of creative artists. **While** some people disargee with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.

**Some** art projects definitely need the help from the state. **In** the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets and squares in city certres. **In** Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been developed recently. **These** art work represent culture, hefitage and history. **They** serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. **Governments** and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.

**On the other hand**, I can understand  the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. **For example**, state budgets should be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. **These** public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. **Another** reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefor earn their own money by selling their work.

**In conclusion**, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.
