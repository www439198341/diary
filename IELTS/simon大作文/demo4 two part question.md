#### ESSAY
**It** is true that editors have difficult decisions about what news stories they broadcast or publish, and their choices are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. **In** my opinion, we are exposed to too much bad news, and I would welcome a great emphasis on good news.

**Editors** face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on. **Firstly**, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers. **Secondly**, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritise stories that are in the public interest. **Finally**, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. **For** example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.

**It** seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. **We** are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people, and we become more cynical about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it. **I** would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. **This** kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

**In** conclusion, it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public servcie.
