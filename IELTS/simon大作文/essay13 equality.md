#### QUESTION
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits.
What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?

#### ESSAY
**In my opinion**, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. **I** completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.

**Education** is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. **I believe** that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. **In** a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the bese learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. **This** kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.

**I** would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people's freedom to succeed or fail. **In other words**, equality doesnot mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. **On the contrary**, I believe that most people would feel more motivited to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. **Those** who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. **Inequality**, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged bakcgrounds.

**In conclusion**, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.
