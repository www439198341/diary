##ESSAY##
It is often argued that the price of tickets for tour destinations should be higher when sold to foreign tourists compared with local residence. Personally, I totally agree with this opinion for several reasons.

On the one hand, the costs for people who live locally with a nationality identification should be less than what they are now. Firstly, the money collected from travellers is used to protect the attractions with cultral and historical value, and part of the tax which is payed by local pay in many different ways is correctly used for that purpose. Secondly, tourists will spend more on food and accommodation which will do more contribute to the local society. Finally, by declining the price, more people can learn better knowledge of their own culture by visiting these places. For example, students from high school and college are just at the age to be educated well, but they usually do not have extra money out of their studying.

On the other hand, tourists who come from other countries should certainly pay more. Firstly, people who can afford a journey to another country usually come from the upper class, and most of them just do not care the price if it is a little bit higher or not. For example, they will not cancel the plan if they know that they are going to pay 10% more than local people. Secondly, it is a quite good way to benifit the economy system. The last and the most important, they did not pay any kind of tax before.

In conclusion, I believe that foreign travellers should pay more than local people for cultrual and historical attractions.
