#### ESSAY
**Many** people choose their jobs based on the size of salary offered. **Personally**, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding a career, because I believe other factors are equally important.

**On** the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basis needs. **For example**, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health and education. **Most** people consider it a priority to at lease earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have reasonable quality of life. **If** people choose there jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. **Artists** and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.

**Nevertheless**, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. **Firstly**, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a work place are extremely important when choosing a job. **Having** a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers' level of happiness and general quality of life. **Secondly**, many people's feelings of job satisfaction come from their personal achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. **Finally**, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.

**In conclusion**, while salaries certainly affect people's choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweights all other motivators.
