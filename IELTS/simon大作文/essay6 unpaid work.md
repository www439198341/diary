#### ESSAY
**Many** young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be benifical for both the individual and the society as a whole. **However**, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.

**Most** young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without the added reponsibilities of working in their spare time. **School** is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revisions on top of attending lessons every day. **When** young people do have some free time, we would encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. **They** have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.

**At the same time**, I do not believe that the society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. **In fact**, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. **Doing** this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. **Currently**, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the bese system.

**In conclusion**, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.
