#### ESSAY
**It is true** that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. **Although** there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

**As** people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. **The** main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. **The** proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less taxes in relation to the size of the population. **In other words**, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. **Further** pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact that young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.

**There** are several actions that governments chould take to solve the problems described above. **Firstly**, a simple solution would be increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. **Nowadays**, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. **A second measure** would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. **Finally**, money from nation budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accomodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.

**In conclusion**, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.
