#### ESSAY
**It** is true that the behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent year. **There** are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem.

**In** my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the way young people behaive at school nowadays. **Firstly**, modern parents tend to be too tenient or permissive. **Many** children are accustomed to getting whatever they want, they find it difficult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits imposed on them by school rules. **Secondly**, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools. **Finally**, children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities, many of whom set an example that success can be achieved without finishing school.

**Student** behaviour can certainly be imporved. **I** believe that the change must start with parents, who need to be persuaded that it is important to set firm rules for their children. **When** children misbehave or break thr rules, parents should use reasonable punishments to demonstrate that actions have consequences. **Also**, schools can play an important role in training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the communication of both groups. **At** the same time, famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have to act as role models to children.

**In** conclusion, schools will continue to face disipline problems unless parents, teachers and public figures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.
