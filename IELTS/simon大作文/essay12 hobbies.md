#### ESSAY
**Some** hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. **Personally**, I believe that both type of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.

**On the one hand**, many people enjoy easy hobbies. **One example** of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. **I** remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. **Another** hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. **In my opinion**, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing to much about the technicalities of operating a camera. **Despite** being straightforward, taking photo is a satisfying activity.

**On the other hand**, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. **If** an activity is more chanllenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. **For example**, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. **In my case**, it tooke me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. **I believe** that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.

**In conclusion**, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.
