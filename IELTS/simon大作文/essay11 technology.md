#### ESSAY
**It is true** that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. **Technology** has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.

**Technology** has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. **Firstly**, telephones and internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. **Secondly**, services like Skype created new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. **For example**, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. **Finally**, many people use social networks, like Facebook to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and the interact through their computers rather than face to face.

**On the one hand**, these developments can be extremely positive. **Cooperation** between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. **Nowadays**, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benifit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. **On the other hand**, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. **For example**, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these 'virtual' relationships are a poor substitute for real relationships.

**In conclusion**, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.
