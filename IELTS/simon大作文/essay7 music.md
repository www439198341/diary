#### ESSAY
**It** is true that a variety of musical styles can be found around the world. **Music** is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that troditional music is more important than modern, international music.

**Music** is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. **As children**, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning languages, or simply as a form of enjoyment. **Children** delight in sing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. **Later in life**, people's musical preference develope, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. **Music** both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone can not. **In short**, it is difficult to imagine life without it.

**In my opinion**, troditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. **International** pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. **Troditional** music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of country. **Troditional styles**, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. **It** would be a real pity if pop music become so predominant and these national styles disappeared.

**In conclusion**, music is a necessary part of human existance, and I believe that troditional music should be given more importance than international music.
