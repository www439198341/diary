#### QUESTION
Nowadays animals experiments are widely used to develope new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that thess experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while other are in favour of them because of their benifites to humanity.

#### ESSAY
**It** is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. **While** I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.

**On the one hand**, there clear ethical arguments animal experimentation. **To** use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectivness of a new drug can be measured. **Opponents** of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of drauma, and the lives of all creatures should be respected. **They** believe that the benifits to all humans do not justify the suffering caused, and scientists should use alternative methods of research.

**On the other hand**, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be avaliable. **Supporters** of the use of animals in medicine research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. **They** argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families need a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. **Personally**, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a nesessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.

**In conclusion**, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.
