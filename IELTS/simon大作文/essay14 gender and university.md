#### ESSAY
**In my opinion**, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. **However**, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.

**Having** the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. **Student** numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. **If** a university desided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applications of each gender. **In reality**, many course are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. **For example**, nursing courses tend to attract more female applications, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.

**Apart** from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. **Universities** should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. **In this way**, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. **If** a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.

**In conclusion**, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.
