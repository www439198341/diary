#### ESSAY
**It** is sometimes argued tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. **I** completely disagree with this idea.

**The** argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means the local resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. **However**, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. **Foreign** tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accomondation and travel. **The** governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidies important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.

**If** travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultrual attractions in an particular nation, they would perhaps deside not to go to that country on holiday. **To** take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul's Cathedral. **These** two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote nation's cultural heritage. **If** overseas tourists stopped comming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.

**In** conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourist from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.
