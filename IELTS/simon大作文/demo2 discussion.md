#### ESSAY
**People** have diffenent views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative. **While** a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.

**On** the one hand, competition can be a great source of motivation for children. **When** teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class. **This** kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children's confidence, while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. **When** these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. **It** can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

**On** the other hand, it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. **In** the workplace, adults are expected to work in teams, follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff. **Team** collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win. **This** is the attitude that I beleive schools should foster in young people. **Instead** of promoting the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they could gain more from working together.

**In** conclusion, I can understand that why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much more desirable in adult life.
