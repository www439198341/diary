#### QUESTION
Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful education tool. Others, however, believe that video games are having an adverse effect on people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benifits?

#### ESSAY
**Many** people, and children in particular, enjon playing computer games. **While** I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effict on their user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.

**On the one hand**, video games can be both entertaining and educational. **Users**, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. **From** an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside gaming context. **Furthermore**, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users' motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.

**However**, I would argue that these benifits are outweighed by the drawbacks. **Gaming** can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. **Many** children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. **This** type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or the console. **The** rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.

**In conclusion**, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.
